# J124-Week-4-Quiz-Question-6

I picked the question **do you ever recline your seat when you fly?** because I think it is one of the most common actions to take when flying in an aeroplane.

The *frequency* at which this occurs is less than I had anticipated, but the data outcome was very interesting to me.

As someone who almost always reclines their seat in an aeroplane, I was surprised to see the frequency at which it **was not.**

This is the chart I made in an earlier exercise:
